# Foodiary Landing Page

This is the marketing landing page for **Foodiary**, an AI-powered nutrition and diet tracking app currently in development.

**All numbers and data is mocked, and should not be taken seriously (yet...)**

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Inside

This project explores modern web practices to boost product visibility and user engagement before launch:

- **A/B Testing with GrowthBook**  
  Used to test UI variations and feature flags to experiment with conversion strategies in a real-world scenario.

- **Headless CMS with Sanity.io**  
  A blog section powered by Sanity enables dynamic content updates without redeploying the site.

## ðŸ§ª Why Experiment

This setup allows me to explore strategies that support growth and content flexibility early in the product lifecycle â€” combining developer experience with marketing adaptability.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Vite + React
- Tailwind CSS
- GrowthBook SDK
- Sanity.io
- TypeScript

> This project is part of the foundation for the future launch of the Foodiary app.
